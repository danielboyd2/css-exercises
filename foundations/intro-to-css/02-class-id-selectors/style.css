/* Notes:
- I grouped `.number1`, `.number3`, and `.number5` in the same rule because they share styles. 
    - Don't forget to use commas to separate selectors when grouping.
- ID selectors use `#` (e.g., `#number2`, `#number4`), and they should be unique to the page.
- Class selectors use `.` (e.g., `.number3`), and they can be reused on multiple elements.
- To avoid redundancy:
   - I could have assigned a common class (e.g., `.odd-numbers`) to `.number1` and `.number5` for shared styles.
   - Additional styles for `.number3` could also be added within the same class definition.
- Best Practice: Keep IDs for unique elements (e.g., `#number2`) and use classes for reusable styles.
